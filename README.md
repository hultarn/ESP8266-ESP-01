# ESP8266-ESP-01
Base project for setting up the ESP8266 ESP-01 that will be used in future IoT appliactions

# Wiring
Since the ESP8266 ESP-01 isn't breadboard friendly I will be using an ESP8266 ESP-01 breakout board. I'll also be using an Arduino Uno. 



Don't power the ESP8266 ESP-01 with 5V since it will ruin the board. The voltage divider is necessary since the Arduino Uno outputs 5V on it's digital outputs.
